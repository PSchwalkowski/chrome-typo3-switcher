This extension adds button to the Chrome's toolbar that opens a tab with TYPO3 Backend of current site, or a Frontend, if detects it is in Backend.

Some time ago there was a similar extension, but it simply opened current domain + /typo3/ segment - I've used it for a long time though. Thanks to the author of original ext, Patrick Lischka, for inspirations to improve this idea.

My ext goes further and it can open back the Frontend from Backend, also it can not only add a path to a domain, but tries to extract the <base> tag from a page source, then uses it for a backend url (or just a domain, if not found).
So it works as expected when running TYPO3 project in subdirectory, ie. on your dev environment.
(For this, it needs that you set <base href="[url]"> in <head>)
