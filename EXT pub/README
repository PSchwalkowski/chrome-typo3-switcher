This extension adds button to the Chrome's toolbar that opens a tab with TYPO3 Backend of current site,
or a Frontend, if detects it is in Backend.

Some time ago there was a similar extension, but it simply opened current domain + /typo3/ segment - I've used it
for a long time though. Thanks to the author of original ext, Patrick Lischka, for inspirations to improve this idea.

My ext goes further and it can open back the Frontend from Backend, also it can not only add a path to a domain, but
tries to extract the <base> tag from a page source, then uses it for a backend url (or just a domain, if not found).
So it works as expected when running TYPO3 project in subdirectory, ie. on your dev environment.
(For this, it needs that you set <base href="[url]"> in <head>)

Switching to Frontend opens last selected page in backend page tree (works similar as View webpage button in backend,
but works even if currently some module without page tree /or such button/ is open).
(tested in versions 6.2, 7.6 and 8.7. any between should work as well)
